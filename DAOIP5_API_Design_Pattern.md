# DAOIP-5 API Design Pattern for Grant Systems
*A comprehensive guide for publishing DAOIP-5 compliant grant data*

## Overview

This design pattern enables organizations to publish their grant data following the DAOIP-5 standard while maintaining the same quality standards as the OpenGrants Gateway API. Organizations can implement this pattern to make their data easily integrable with aggregation platforms.

## Core Principles

### Data Quality Standards
- **Semantic IDs**: Use consistent ID formats (`daoip5:{org}:grantPool:{id}`)
- **Date Formatting**: ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone (`2024-08-08T20:15:00Z`)
- **Currency Handling**: String format for monetary amounts with USD equivalents
- **Schema Compliance**: All responses must follow DAOIP-5 structure

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Bearer token support with anonymous access fallback
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user limits (100+ requests/min) and anonymous limits (20/min)
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints

### Performance Standards
- **Response Times**: List endpoints < 500ms, individual resources < 300ms
- **Availability**: Target 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Pagination**: Support limit/offset with comprehensive metadata

## Integration with OpenGrants Gateway

Once your system implements this pattern, integration with the OpenGrants Gateway follows this process:

1. **Registration**: Submit your system metadata and data availability
2. **Validation**: Gateway validates DAOIP-5 compliance
3. **Adapter Creation**: Gateway creates a lightweight adapter for your system
4. **Testing**: End-to-end integration testing
5. **Production**: Your data becomes available through the unified API

### Adapter Integration Benefits
Your data becomes accessible through unified queries:
- Individual system queries: `?system=your-org`
- Cross-system aggregation: Combined results from multiple grant systems
- Standardized filtering and pagination across all integrated systems

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- [ ] Map your data to DAOIP-5 schema structure
- [ ] Implement semantic ID formatting
- [ ] Add USD currency conversion
- [ ] Ensure date format standardization

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Validate all responses follow DAOIP-5 schema
- [ ] Test data completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Implement error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Add monitoring and health checks

### Phase 3: Integration Ready
- [ ] Set up authentication for API access
- [ ] Implement rate limiting policies
- [ ] Add CORS headers for web integration
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation

### Phase 4: Gateway Integration
- [ ] Submit integration request to OpenGrants Gateway
- [ ] Provide test data for validation
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Benefits of DAOIP-5 Compliance

### For Organizations
- **Increased Visibility**: Your grants appear in unified grant discovery platforms
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent data structure reduces integration overhead
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Data works with multiple aggregation services
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured validation ensures data integrity

### For Developers
- **Unified Interface**: Single API to access multiple grant systems
- **Consistent Schema**: Same data structure across all integrated systems
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Rich extensions for system-specific information
- **Reliable Performance**: Standardized rate limiting and error handling

### For Grant Seekers
- **Comprehensive Discovery**: Find grants across multiple platforms in one place
- **Consistent Information**: Standardized format makes comparison easier
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data from all integrated grant systems
- **Enhanced Search**: Powerful filtering across all grant programs

This design pattern ensures your grant system data meets the highest quality standards while maintaining the flexibility to showcase your organization's unique features through the standardized extensions mechanism.
