
I want a Grant Ecosystem Analytics Dashboard,
In the landing page, we will have stats shuch X amount of funding distributed, Y Grant rounds Z grant systems integrated and accross P projects and C categories search filters (date range, amount, etc)
 visualizations (total funding by quarter breakdown & trend, )

and then I want to have a page called Grant Systems, where each grant systems integrated will have theri own card, upon clicking on tht card it takes me to the Grant system Profile page, where we have indiduval grant system page

I want a side nvigation bar

    - [ ]  Landing page with funding stats 
    - [ ]  Grant ecosystem profile pages
        - [ ]  Stellar profile page ( Grant system Profile Page)
            - [ ]  Stats: total applications, application approval rate
            - [ ]  Individual rounds (in descending order) with nested tables (projects & amount funding)
            - [ ]  Visualizations: funding distributed per round
- [ ]  Build cross-system comparison view and grantee overlap analysis in a differennt page

To Access Giveth And Octant Data

here's API documentatin
```

```

For each data point, Fetch Grant Pools, fetch all applications for that grant pools, this is in Grant system page, I want this to be similar to https://retrolist.app/

- Enhancing featues,
Implement search and filet andadd caching so that the app isn't stuck in loading state

implement modular intergation so that in future I can just drop the URL and you integrate a nw data source, the URL maybe of grants.daostar.org or daoip5.daostar.org
