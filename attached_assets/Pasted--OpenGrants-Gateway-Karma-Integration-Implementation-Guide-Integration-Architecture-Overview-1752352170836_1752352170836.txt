# OpenGrants Gateway: Karma Integration Implementation Guide

## Integration Architecture Overview

**Goal**: Enhance existing grant records with Karma project identifiers by implementing a matching service that searches Karma's project database and appends `x-karma-project-uid` fields to grant applications.

**Integration Pattern**: Post-processing enhancement layer that operates on standardized DAOIP-5 grant data, adding cross-platform project identity without modifying core grant processing logic.

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: API Discovery and Documentation**

**Karma API Analysis Requirements:**
- Extract complete API schema from the Postman collection using Postman's export functionality
- Document all available search endpoints, particularly those supporting project lookup by name, wallet address, GitHub repository
- Identify rate limits, authentication requirements, and response formats
- Map Karma's project data structure to understand available fields for matching and enhancement
- Determine which Karma fields provide stable, long-term project identifiers

**Documentation Extraction Process:**
- Export Postman collection as OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Generate human-readable API documentation from schema
- Create endpoint inventory with request/response examples
- Document error handling patterns and status codes

### **Phase 2: Matching Algorithm Design**

**Multi-Tier Matching Strategy:**

**Tier 1 - High Confidence Matches:**
- Exact wallet address matching between grant applicant and Karma project owner
- Direct GitHub repository URL matching
- Exact project name matching with additional validation criteria

**Tier 2 - Medium Confidence Matches:**
- Fuzzy string matching on project names using algorithms like Levenshtein distance
- Partial GitHub organization/username matching
- Cross-reference with known aliases or alternative project names

**Tier 3 - Low Confidence Matches:**
- Semantic similarity matching on project descriptions
- Matching based on team member overlaps
- Category-based heuristic matching

**Confidence Scoring Framework:**
- Develop scoring rubric (0-100) based on match quality and verification methods
- Establish minimum confidence thresholds for automatic vs. manual review
- Create fallback mechanisms for ambiguous matches

### **Phase 3: Data Enhancement Service Architecture**

**Service Layer Design:**
- Create dedicated Karma integration service separate from core grant processing
- Implement batch processing capabilities for bulk grant enhancement
- Design caching layer to avoid redundant Karma API calls for known projects
- Build retry logic with exponential backoff for API reliability

**Data Flow Architecture:**
- Input: Standardized DAOIP-5 grant records from existing Gateway API
- Processing: Karma project search and matching algorithm execution
- Output: Enhanced grant records with additional `x-karma-*` fields
- Audit: Matching confidence scores and method documentation

### **Phase 4: API Integration Points**

**Endpoint Enhancement Strategy:**
- Modify existing grant retrieval endpoints to accept optional `enhance_karma` parameter
- Create dedicated Karma search endpoints for direct project lookup
- Implement bulk enhancement endpoints for historical data processing
- Add administrative endpoints for match review and override

**Response Schema Enhancement:**
- Extend existing DAOIP-5 response format with Karma fields using `x-` prefix convention
- Maintain backward compatibility by making Karma fields optional
- Include metadata about enhancement process (confidence scores, match methods)
- Provide clear indication when Karma enhancement was requested but failed

### **Phase 5: Quality Assurance and Validation**

**Matching Accuracy Validation:**
- Develop test dataset with known correct matches for algorithm validation
- Implement human review workflow for medium-confidence matches
- Create feedback mechanism to improve matching algorithms over time
- Establish metrics for false positive and false negative rates

**Data Quality Monitoring:**
- Track enhancement success rates across different grant ecosystems
- Monitor Karma API reliability and response times
- Implement alerting for degraded matching performance
- Create dashboard for operational visibility

### **Phase 6: Configuration and Deployment**

**Environment Configuration:**
- Karma API credentials and endpoint configuration
- Rate limiting and timeout parameters
- Matching algorithm tuning parameters
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Implement feature behind configuration flag for safe testing
- Deploy to staging environment with subset of grant data
- Conduct load testing with realistic API call volumes
- Plan rollback strategy for integration issues

## Data Mapping and Field Enhancement

### **Standard Enhancement Fields**

**Core Karma Integration Fields:**
- `x-karma-project-uid`: Stable Karma project identifier
- `x-karma-match-confidence`: Algorithm confidence score
- `x-karma-match-method`: How the match was determined
- `x-karma-last-updated`: Timestamp of enhancement

**Extended Karma Data Fields:**
- `x-karma-project-score`: Karma's internal project scoring
- `x-karma-project-profile`: Link to Karma project profile
- `x-karma-indexed-sources`: List of platforms where Karma found this project
- `x-karma-verification-status`: Project verification level in Karma

### **Cross-Platform Identity Linking**

**Unified Project Identity Strategy:**
- Create project identity graph linking Karma UIDs with other platform identifiers
- Map relationships between Gitcoin project IDs, Giveth project IDs, and Karma UIDs
- Implement deduplication logic for projects appearing across multiple platforms
- Design conflict resolution for inconsistent project information

## Operational Considerations

### **Performance and Scalability**

**API Rate Management:**
- Implement intelligent batching to respect Karma API rate limits
- Design queue system for processing large historical datasets
- Cache frequent project lookups to reduce API load
- Monitor API quota usage and implement throttling

**System Performance:**
- Benchmark enhancement processing time vs. grant dataset size
- Optimize database queries for enhanced grant record storage
- Implement streaming processing for real-time grant ingestion
- Design horizontal scaling for increased grant volume

### **Error Handling and Resilience**

**Fault Tolerance Design:**
- Graceful degradation when Karma API is unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for persistent API issues
- Fallback to cached project data when possible

**Data Consistency:**
- Handle partial enhancement failures in batch processing
- Implement transaction boundaries for atomic grant record updates
- Design reconciliation process for inconsistent enhancement states
- Create audit trail for all enhancement operations

### **Monitoring and Observability**

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Enhancement success rate by grant ecosystem
- Average confidence scores for successful matches
- API response times and error rates
- Cache hit rates and effectiveness

**Alerting Strategy:**
- Low enhancement success rates indicating algorithm issues
- High API error rates suggesting service problems
- Unusual patterns in confidence score distribution
- Performance degradation in grant processing pipeline

This implementation approach ensures robust, scalable integration of Karma project data while maintaining the reliability and performance of the existing OpenGrants Gateway API.
